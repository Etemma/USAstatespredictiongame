🐢 U.S. States Guessing Game

An interactive map quiz built with Python Turtle Graphics and Pandas.
The program displays a blank map of the United States and prompts the player to guess state names.
When a correct state is entered, its name appears on the map at the correct coordinates.
At the end of the game, a CSV file (learn.csv) is generated containing the states the player missed — allowing for replay and learning.
